# TaxCalculatorApp-VB
This project was created as part of my Year 11 Software Design &amp; Development course in 2023. It is a VB.NET Windows Forms application that allows users to input employee names and gross incomes, then calculates the applicable tax and net income based on Australian tax brackets.
